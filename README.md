## Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up both the backend and frontend of the Snapgram project.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the backend root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with your actual MongoDB connection string and `your-jwt-secret` with a secure random string for JWT encryption.

4. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

   Note: Ensure that you have created an `init-db` script in your `package.json` file that sets up your initial database schema or seeds any necessary data.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command should start your backend server, typically on `http://localhost:5000` or another specified port.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the frontend root directory and add any necessary variables. For example:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   This sets the base URL for your API calls to the backend.

4. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start your frontend application, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Verifying the Setup

1. Backend: Open your browser or use a tool like Postman to make a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/api/` (adjust the port if necessary). You should receive a response indicating that the server is running.

2. Frontend: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Snapgram application running.

3. Full Stack: Try to register a new user or log in with an existing user to verify that the frontend can communicate with the backend successfully.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with MongoDB connection, ensure that your MongoDB server is running and that the connection string in the `.env` file is correct.
- For any missing dependencies, run `npm install` in the respective directories again.
- Check the console output for both backend and frontend for any error messages that might indicate specific issues.

If you continue to face problems, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the development team for support.

Happy coding! üöÄ
